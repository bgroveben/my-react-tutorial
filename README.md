## My React Tutorial

I'm learning React my own damn way, but I'm going to be cribbing and copying stuff from here:  
https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial  
and here:  
https://github.com/facebook/react  

To run this app:  
=> node server.js  
Open your browser localhost:8080 and type the name and location of the file you wish to run.  
Example:  
http://localhost:8080/examples/basic/index.html

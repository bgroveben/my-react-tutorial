I'm learning React my own damn way, but I'm going to be cribbing and copying stuff from here:

To run this app, open your terminal, make sure you are in the same directory as the server.js file, and type:  
=> node server.js  
Open your browser to localhost:8080 and type the name and location of the file you wish to run.  
Example:  
http://localhost:8080/examples/basic/index.html

## React Examples

Here we go with the cribbing and copying with the [examples you see here](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples).  
For now I am using a [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react/) instead of including libraries in this repo.

To run this app, open your terminal, make sure you are in the same directory as the server.js file, and type:  
=> node server.js  
Open your browser to localhost:8080 and type the name and location of the file you wish to run.  
Example:  
http://localhost:8080/examples/basic/index.html
